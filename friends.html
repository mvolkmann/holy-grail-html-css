    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p>
      So no one told you life was going to be this way.
      Your job's a joke, you're broke, you're love life's DOA.
      It's like you're always stuck in second gear,
      Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour.
      I'll be there for you, like I've been there before.
      I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're still in bed at ten, the work began at eight.
      You've burned your breakfast, so far, things are going great.
      Your mother warned you there'd be days like these,
      But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour.
      I'll be there for you, like I've been there before.
      I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me.
      Seems like you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me.
      Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with,
      Someone I'll always laugh with, even at my worst, I'm best with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's like you're always stuck in second gear,

      But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour.
      I'll be there for you, like I've been there before.
      I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too.
