# holy-grail-html.css

This demonstrates the holy grail of HTML/CSS page layout.
The requirements are:

- a header that is always visible
- a footer that is always visible
- a left nav in desktop view that scrolls independently from the main content
- a main content area that scrolls independently of the left nav

Here's are some screenshots.
